Developed Fragrantia, a stylish and user-friendly e-commerce website focused on selling clothing and perfume products. The project was built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, with a strong emphasis on creating a responsive UI/UX design that ensures seamless user experience across devices. The layout was carefully structured to showcase products elegantly, optimize accessibility, and enhance overall customer engagement. This project helped me strengthen my skills in frontend development and responsive design principles.
